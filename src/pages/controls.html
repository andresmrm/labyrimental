<p>In this game you will need to be guided by sounds. So a headphone is <b>highly</b> recommended.</p>
<p>It's also <b>highly</b> recommended to play it using a recent Firefox or Chromium/Chrome. Firefox seems to play the sounds better.</p>
<p>Use the <b>arrow keys</b> to walk and the <b>spacebar</b> to interact.
Or click or touch the top/bottom parts of the screen to walk forward/backward and the left/right to rotate. Click/tap the middle of the screen to interact.</p>
<a onClick="window.openPage('instrorstart')">Ok</a>
