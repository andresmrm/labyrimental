## Build&Run

If you want to modify the source code and build it, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) which should come with a copy of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

Copy the files of this game to a folder and, inside of that folder, run this line to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

And this line to build and run a small server that should automatically update the browser on code changes:

```
npm run dev
```

Than open a browser and check the game in this a local address: http://localhost:5001
